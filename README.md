**Project:** Optimizing Travel Itineraries With Machine Learning

**Project goal.** The goal of my project is to optimize travel routes for a delivery vehicle by using machine learning model predictions. This is a two-component problem: first, I train a machine learning model on the data to predict how long it will take a delivery vehicle to go from point one point to another, and I feed these predictions into a genetic algorithm which decides which is the most time efficient visit order for a given set of points.
